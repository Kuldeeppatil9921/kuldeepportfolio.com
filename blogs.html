        <h2 class="h2">Indian Education System: What Needs to be Changed for Quality Learning?</h2>
        <p class="p">
            Nearly a quarter of India’s population is in the age of attending school and college and the question of quality learning is always there with such a huge population. Keeping this into consideration, a number of measures have been taken by the educational institutions to enhance the quality of education in India. Our current contribution to the education sector is 4.6% of GDP and the government is aiming to achieve around 6% of GDP for education in the coming years.

            But still, there are several other issues that need to be taken care of. The literacy rate in India is just 74.04%. According to the “Annual Status of Education Report 2017”, it was assessed that about 25% of students in the age group of 14-18 years could not read basic text fluently in their own language, and more than half faced challenges in performing basic arithmetic. This shows the lack of quality education.

            We have established a number of IITs, IIMs, Law schools, etc and students are even scoring 100% in their class 12 results, then what are the changes that are required in our Education system? Following is the list of measures that need to be taken to improvise the education system in India
        </p>
        <h3 class="h2">1. Encourage Research Work</h3>
        <p class="p">Many times, our education system fails to reward the person who deserves the highest academic accolades. That is why we need a provision that will recognize the original contribution. This would help in changing our education system at a better pace. This will encourage more research and innovation work.</p>
        <h3 class="h2">2. Introduction to Different Opportunities</h3>
        <p class="p">
            We are still living in a world where the science stream tops the stream hierarchy. The intelligence of a student is judged on the basis of the stream he has selected. They should be introduced to various other career options and their choices should not be made limited to just science and commerce stream. There are around 2,000 courses on the SWAYAM portal, students can easily access them to learn new concepts
        </p>
        <h3 class="h2">3. Smart Educators</h3>
        <p class="p">In today’s fast-changing world, we do need smart educators as well. We need leaders, entrepreneurs in teaching positions, not salaried people trying to hold on to their mantle. In India, schools are investing up to 20% of their budget on teacher and administrator training. Teachers play the most important role in a teaching institution, hence they should be given the best training. </p>
        <h3 class="h2">4. Technology Trends</h3>
        <p class="p">There should be a massive technology infrastructure for education. The outdated models of brick and mortar schools and colleges now need to be replaced by the efficient educational delivery mechanisms that can actually take the wealth of human knowledge to the masses.</p>
        <h3 class="h2">5. One to One Education</h3>
        <p class=" p">In such a diverse nation like India, how can we expect the absorption power of every student to be the same? We need to realize that one teaching method cannot be beneficial for everyone in a class of 30. Some can learn at a faster pace and some at a slower pace. So, we do need personalized learning in this respect. For this, we can implement some of the technologies like artificial intelligence and chatbots which can help teachers in giving education to the students effectively. </p>
        
        <h3 class="h2">7. Co-Curricular Activities</h3>
        <p class="p">Co-Curricular Activities not just boost confidence but also enhance the experience of a student. There will be an increase in the child’s capacity to emphatically confront the practical situations in the near future. They instill various skills like leadership, sportsmanship, teamwork, practical solidarity as well as productive thinking. </p>
