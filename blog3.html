        <h1 class="h2">What are the benefits of remote working for employees</h1>
        <h2 class="h2"><b>WHAT IS REMOTE WORK?</b></h2>
        <p class="p">Remote work is a working style that allows professionals to work outside of a traditional office environment. It is based on the concept that work does not need to be done in a specific place to be executed successfully.following are some advantages & disadvantages of remote working</p>
        <h2 class="h2">1. Freedom and Flexibility</h2>
        <p class="p"><b>Remote workers appreciate their freedom.</b> They can plan their day to suit both their work and home life, as long as they do the set hours at the right time. Having the flexibility to attend medical appointments, watch the kids’ basketball game, or take elderly parents shopping can lighten the load. And not having to ask special permission or fit in with other team members takes the pressure off too. When an employer allows employees this kind of freedom it builds trust and gives more job satisfaction.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">2. Cost saving</h2>
        <p class="p">Going to work can be expensive. You’ve got travel costs, parking, lunch, coffee and snacks, birthday cakes, colleague presents, clothes for work… the list is endless. Some employers even give refreshment or clothing allowances as a benefit.<b>Remote working saves on these expenses,</b> which can add up to a substantial amount. This means more disposable income available for other things, which is always a good thing.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">3. Save time</h2>
        <p class="p">
            As well as saving time on commuting, having a remote job means<b> employees manage their own schedules.</b> Some people work better in the mornings than in the afternoons. And some come alive with ideas in the evenings. As long as the time you’re working doesn’t affect your colleagues and you meet deadlines then you can work when you wish.

            Working remotely also saves time traveling to and being in meetings as modern technology means teams can video call on the intranet.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2">4. Location</h2>
        <p>Another one of the benefits of working remotely for employees is that they can work from anywhere.<b> People don’t have to be bound to a city that doesn’t correspond to their standards or preference,</b> which also helps avoid unnecessary travelling. If a spouse has to be based or allocated in a particular location, remote working allows partners to keep their job, or at least ease the transition period. Working remotely means it doesn’t matter if you live at the top of a mountain or next to the sea. As long as you have a good internet connection you can work from any location in the world.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">5. Peace and quiet</h2>
        <p class="p">A traditional office is often noisy and distracting. Phones are ringing, people are talking, and there’s a general buzz. Whilst this is great from a social point of view it can be difficult to work in this environment. Some people need to work in total silence to focus. Working remotely, particularly from home, can allow for creative thinking and greater productivity. Whether there’s a great view from the window or a brick wall – silence is golden.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">Disadvantages of Remote Work</h1>
        <h2 class="h2">1.Isolation</h2>
        <p class="p">
            It’s easy for employees to feel like they’re part of a company’s bigger picture when they’re in the office and brainstorming with coworkers every day. Remote work can make it more difficult for employees to feel connected to and involved with daily company happenings, which can ultimately lower morale.

        </p>
        <h2 class="h2">2.Decreased Employee Visibility</h2>
        <p class="p">Employees may hesitate to accept a remote position due to decreased visibility within the organization. They may feel that a lack of face time with their manager or other company leaders will make it more difficult for them to be awarded promotions or other growth opportunities.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">3.Decreased Work/Life Balance</h2>
        <p class="p">It may seem like working at home would make it easier for employees to have a work/life balance, but some argue that not having a physical distinction between where an employee works and where they spend their free time can actually make it more difficult for them to unplug, stop focusing on work, and enjoy time away from their jobs.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">4.Lack of Relationships Among Coworkers</h2>
        <p class="p">Working together in an office provides employees with the opportunity to bond over shared experiences and build camaraderie with each other. Working remotely makes it more difficult to establish this relationship among coworkers, even when a company chooses to utilize teleconferencing, online chat systems, and other communication tools.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">5.Increased Distractions</h2>
        <p class="p">While employees undoubtedly experience day-to-day distractions in an office, it’s possible that they face even more distractions at home: children, spouses, pets, the latest Netflix craze, etc. Everyone’s in-home workspace is different, as is their ability to shutout distractions. But if an employee consistently shows a lack of focus or dedication, they may not be a good fit for remote work.</p>
